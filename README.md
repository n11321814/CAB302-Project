// Canvas Project Synopsis
Develop a fun and interactive application that provides students with personalized study tips, motivational quotes, and fun predictions, similar to a digital fortune cookie.
The AI will generate unique messages based on the student's study habits, progress, and preferences.
This tool aims to make studying more enjoyable and engaging by offering daily doses of encouragement and useful advice

// To Do

Sign up/in system connected to database
AI integration to produce fortune
Personalized study tips and advice
Motivational quotes tailored to students
Fun predictions to keep students engaged
Progress tracking to tailor messages
